0.3.2

* sync multi command fix (avoid infinite response loop)

=====
* Replaced TimeoutException with SocketException(10060) which is the more appropriate socket timeout exception

0.3
===
* Replaced IStatsCollector with IClacksInstrumentation for better hooks into current state of the server
* Fixed various issues that could cause errors under load
  * New client and server request processing logic
  * Fixed bad Socket.Listen queue size
* ConnectionPool
  * most recently used sockets are now added to the front of the available queue, since they have a higher likelyhood of still being connected
  * do not check Connected on socket on each pool fetch, since it has significant overhead
  * Better Connected logic (i.e. polls socket, rather than just use the socket's Connected field)
  * When the pool is exhausted, incoming requests for sockets are now queue'd for ConnectTimeout rather than failing immediately
* ClackClient
  * Added auto-reconnect/retry on request failure (assumes stateless server, can be turned off)
  * now requires an IConnectionPool, so while host/port & IPEndpoint Ctor's still exist, the ISocket Ctor is gone
* Added the Client's endpoint to server's Request object
